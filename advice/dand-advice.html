			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask!</h4>
			<p>When you begin your studies in web development, you might feel that you don't want to ask any questions. It could be that you don't want it to appear that you're not picking up the knowledge, or that you feel that you are too new to burden anybody.</p>

			<p>The asking of questions, however, is a sign that you are interested and enthusiastic.</p>

			<h4>Humility is an important factor.</h4>
			<p>Maintaining a humble, cordial attitude is essential when requesting direction or clarification.  It shows that you are open and respectful of those who have gone before you.</p>

			<p>Ask questions and stay the course.  Things will become more and more clear.</p>

			<p>Practice, and the act of reaching out, will help to propel you to a new level of understanding and ability.  If you're not grasping the "why" of some of the tasks of development, you will.  Just give it time.</p>
