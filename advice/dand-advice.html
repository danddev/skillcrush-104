			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask!</h4>
			<p>At first, web development can be a daunting endeavor.  This does not meant that we should feel intimidated.  When we need help, we should ask, without fear.</p>

			<p>Those who have gone before us are normally quite willing to help - and it even makes them feel good and proud.</p>

			<h4>It is important to remain open.</h4>
			<p>As you progress in your learning, remember to remain receptive to advice from those at a higher level.  It is easy for us to feel that we no longer need direction - but it is beneficial to all when we continue to learn as much as we can.</p>

			<p>We should also begin to feel a desire to help those who are just strting out, as we once were.  In this way, the cycle of knowledge can continue to remain strong.</p>

			<p>If we all remain brave, receptive and considerate, we can do great things!</p>
